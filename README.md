# hello-world
first test of github

It's been a very long time since I wrote any code but I'm studying for a job interview and github looks super useful to know.
I'll be either a technical program manager or a product manager but my skills have languished and I need to study up and get familiar with the new technical tools (other than JIRA which I know quite well already).
